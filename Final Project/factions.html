            <h1>Welcome to The Empire</h1>
            <h2 class="pyros">Pyros</h2>
            <h3>The passionate, infamous, and dangerous fire faction led by the audatious House Baltizar. The Pyros originally were assigned to the military, but war and conquest depleated the faction's population over time. House Baltizar rebelled against the three other Great Houses, leading to the exile of the house and its people.</h3>
        
            <h2 class="aquarius">Aquarius</h2>
            <h3>The humble and hard working of the empire, led by illustrious House Wentworth. Known as the backbone and the future of the empire, the Aquarius cover many feilds ranging from education to agriculture. The water faction can commonly be found along costal cities and the bread belt. Aquarians comprise nearly 40% of the empire's population.</h3>
            
            <h2 class="stratos">Stratos</h2>
            <h3>The brains of the empire, led by cunning House Regent. The stratos have uncanny brilliance. The most elite of the empire's industries are reserved for the stratos. The wind weilders tend to segregate the most among the factions by building magnificent cities in the air; exclusive to it's citizens and closed off from the rest of the empire.</h3>
            
            <h2 class="voltaire">Voltaire</h2>
            <h3>The industrius, innovative lightning weilders, led by the powerful House Zimmerman. All of the manufacturing and infrastructure is powered by the Voltaire faction, specifically the Zimmerman Group of Companies. The Voltaires have the greatest class divide in the empire, with the upper class comprising the owners and corporate giants in the Zimmerman group, and the lower class comprising the working class of the faction.</h3>
           
            <h2>Cities in The Empire, a Visualization</h2>
            <h3>The cities of the empire segregate among the factions, so that one city is a "Stratos city". This is most prominent in the capital of the empire, Manhattan. Manhattan is seperated into three different cities; one for each faction, except Pyros because of their exile.</h3>

                <li>The Empire represents the former United States of America</li>
                <li>The four Factions show trends in population in certain geographic areas.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stratos cities are highly aggregated around the East Coast, the capital of the Empire and the richest cities in the empire</li>
                        <li>Aquarius cities are either costal cities or bread belt cities, because their main industries are agriculture and fishing.</li>
                        <li>Voltaires inhabit the industrial capitals of the empire.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Even though cities like Salt Lake city only have a pyros population of 11%, the city is still designated as a Pyros city. It's culture, government, and industry are specifically tailored for the Pyros.</li>
                   <ul>
                <li>The Pyros cities are along the Rocky Mountains. These cities, once major midwest cities, became largely unihabited areas because of the rebel violence.</li>
